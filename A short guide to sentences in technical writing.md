# A short guide to sentences in technical writing

This guide contains one take on how to write technical texts, centered around sentence structure and how sentences relate to one another.

<br>

## Introduction

Over the years, I've picked up a few ideas and concepts I find helpful when writing technical texts. Some of what I'm about to describe comes from style guides and courses in technical writing, while other parts come from trial-and-error. Read this guide to find out more about how *I* write.

So, keep in mind that this text is subjective. This a description of one way—my way—of writing certain texts, not the only way to write. With that in mind, let's get going!

<br>

## Intended audience

This guide is intended for those who write descriptions of how things work, or sets of instructions.

<br>

## Requirements

Before reading this, you should be familiar with basic English grammar.

<br>

## Purpose

Broadly speaking, a sentence is easier to read the shorter and less complex it is. This document aims to describe a few concepts and strategies that can be used for avoiding complexity. What follows is a brief overview on how to construct simple sentences, and how to string them together for clarity. 

This guide does not delve into the following:

* document structure
* illustrations
* layout
* tables

Note: This guide doesn't claim to be exhaustive. Rather, it is an attempt to set down a few easy guidelines, and to provide some inspiration.

## Key points

After reading this guide you should have a better idea about the following:

**Using active voice**:<br>
Use verbs to describe actions performed by a subject, not actions happening to a subject.

**Writing about one topic**:<br>
Use clauses, adverbs and adjectives to add information about a topic. Don't add descriptions or information that don't help in achieving the purpose of your text.

**Writing with flow**:<br>
Make text easier to read by avoiding repetition, and by introducing white space and transitions. Don't add ambiguity by using references that confuse readers.  

<br>

## Using active voice

The *voice* of a sentence affects the length, and subsequently the complexity of a sentence. The average sentence using *active voice*, needs one verb to describe an *action* performed by a subject. In contrast, a sentence using *passive voice* needs additional verbs and prepositions to describe an action *happening* to a subject. So, a good starting point for writing a new sentence is to give the sentence active voice.

Active voice can be written in two different ways. Sentences either follow a ***subject-verb-object* word order (SVO)**, or they can be *imperative* sentences. Read the following section to understand more about SVO and imperatives.

<br>

### Using SVO

In active voice, sentences usually follow a specific word order:

1. **Subject**: <br>
The subject performs an action.
2. **Active verb**: <br>
The verb describes the action.
3. **Object**: <br>
The object acts as a passive *recipient* of the action.

The following is a short list of simple sentences that follow SVO:

* I saw the sign.
* It opened up my mind.
* I closed it, again.

The following list contains sentences using passive voice **(not recommended)**:

* The sign was seen by me.
* My mind was opened up by the sign.
* It was closed again, by me.

As you can see from the examples above, passive voice requires more words to convey the same meaning as active voice. The examples use the helper verb "was" and the preposition "by" in addition to the verbs that describe actions. Use active voice to reduce your word count.

<br>

### Using imperatives

Imperative sentences tell readers what to do directly. An imperative sentence using active voice puts the action first. The subject of an imperative sentence is implicit; it is the reader that is supposed to perform the action an imperative sentence describes.

Imperative sentences work well in lists or sets of instructions. Imperatives need less words than sentences using SVO to describe actions, which is ideal for shorter list items. In addition, lists benefit from being repetitive; when all list items follow the same pattern, the list is easier to scan.

The following is a short list of imperative, active voice sentences:

  1. See the sign.
  2. Open your mind.
  3. Close it, again.

Here are the same sentences, including the implicit *You*:

  1. *You* see the sign.
  2. *You* open your mind.
  3. *You* close it, again.

For contrast, the following list contains imperative sentences using active voice **(not recommended)**:

  1. Let the sign be seen.
  2. Let your mind be opened.
  3. Let it be closed again.

Avoid building a whole text on barking commands at the reader. A text built on commands will get very repetitive and hard to read. So, while using imperative sentences won't hurt, not every sentence should be a command. Always consider whether a sentence needs to be a command before putting it in the body of your text.

## Writing about one topic

It's important that readers understand the topic of a text. If parts of a text don't follow the topic, readers may lose track and be confused. Add detail that helps the reader understand the purpose of your text better, but stay on topic by avoiding unnecessary *descriptions* and *information*.

<br>

### Using clauses

Sentences consist of clauses. A clause is a smaller unit of grammar that contain a subject and a verb. Independent clauses can make up a sentence on their own, while dependent clauses need to be part of a sentence. Clauses can add to the meaning of a sentence, but they also add complexity.

Not every clause is necessary. Some clauses add content without helping readers understand a topic. For example, telling readers when something happens is only important if the reader needs to know how two events or tasks are ordered. Avoid clauses that add information that doesn't help the purpose of your text.

The following is a list of sentences consisting of one clause:

* My dog ate the cake.
* The car stalled.
* I kicked the ball.

The following list contains examples of sentences with multiple clauses:

**Condition**:

* If my dog is naughty, she will eat the cake.
* If I go too slow, my car stalls.
* Since I didn't have other things to do, I kicked the ball.

Note: Placing the condition before the action or active verb of a sentence makes it clear what is required for the action to work. Therefore, when writing a sentence containing a condition, start off with the condition.

**Connection**:

* My dog ate the cake and I wasn't there to stop her.
* The car stalled and I was unhappy.
* I kicked the ball and it all went downhill from there.

**Contrast**:

* My dog ate the cake, but it was small.
* The car stalled, but I have two cars.
* I kicked the ball, but I hadn't thought of the consequences.

**Specification**:

* My dog ate the cake that was sitting on the table.
* The car that used to work stalled.
* I kicked the ball that was in my way.

**Time**:

* My dog ate the cake, after I left the room.
* The car stalled, while my feet worked.
* I kicked the ball, as my wife walked around the corner.

<br>

### Using adjectives

Adjectives are words that describe nouns. Adjectives describe people or objects. You can use adjectives as a way to keep two nouns apart.

The following list contains adjectives:

* angry
* blue
* fluffy
* happy
* intelligent

Use adjectives that help the reader understand your point better. If an adjective lets the reader distinguish between two options, use it. Don't use an adjective to describe an object that you've already defined, or to describe a property that is irrelevant to the topic.

<br>

### Using adverbs

Adverbs are words that describe verbs. Adverbs can be vague or specific. You can use adverbs as a way to negate or modify the meaning of verbs.

The following is a list of adverbs that change the meaning of a verb:

* also
* never
* not
* then

These adverbs inform the reader that something shouldn't be done, or that it should be done in combination with another action. Adverbs that negate or combine actions are quantifiable.  these adverbs to clarify actions.

The following is a list of adverbs that add to the meaning of a verb:

* actually
* belatedly
* quickly
* seldom

The adverbs in the list above shouldn't be used. They don't specify how to act. Vague adverbs add to the complexity of your sentences without adding clarity. For example, saying that something should be done 'quickly' doesn't say anything about time frame or about rate of speed. Replace 'quickly' with a statement saying that the action should be performed within a specific time frame or at a specific rate of speed.

Note: Certain style guides for technical writing also recommend using strong verbs instead of adverb-verb combinations. For example, the phrase "ran quickly" may be replaced with the verb "rushed" without altering the meaning of a sentence. Using strong verbs can give your text more life. However, not all strong verbs are specific. For example, the word "rushed" in the sentence above doesn't provide a timeframe or speed, any more than the word "quickly" did.

## Writing with flow

Text without flow is hard to read. Repetitive text puts readers off. Likewise, text without *white space* becomes a wall of text. Finally, sentences without *transitions* may appear disconnected, as if the text jumps from topic to topic. Write text that flows well by varying language and connecting your sentences together.

Note: Prioritize understanding over flow. Always consider texts from the perspective of the intended readers. Don't use words or expressions your readers might not understand.  

<br>

### Avoiding repetition

Identify repetition by looking at your sentences. First, look out for sequences of sentences that start with the same word, then look at the first sentence of each paragraph. If you find three or more sentences or paragraphs in a row that start with the same word, consider changing one or more of those sentences.

You should also read through any sentences containing multiple clauses. If you find that a sentence refers to the same person or object multiple times, you may want to replace references with pronouns. Likewise, if a sentence contains a list of nouns, consider breaking that list out into a formatted list.

The following list contains three possible strategies to reduce repetition in the body of your text:

**Use synonyms**:

Synonyms are words that mean the same thing. For example, "big" and "large" If readers may mistake the synonym as a reference to a different entity you should not use a synonym. Use synonyms for a repeated word that isn't a technical term or a reference to something specific. 

**Use pronouns**:

Use third person pronouns instead of names or other identifiers. However, if there's any ambiguity on what a pronoun is a reference to, you should avoid the pronoun. Use pronouns close to what they are referring to; if there are more than five words between a pronoun and the noun or phrase the pronoun refers to, the pronoun may confuse readers. You should not use a third person to reference something that comes later in the text. 

The following list contains a few examples of clear pronoun usage:

* My dog ate the cake. She's ill now. 
* I kicked the ball. It didn't travel far.
* My neighbors have a big lawn. However, they rarely go outside.

The following sentence is an example of a sentence with ambiguous pronoun usage:

>He saw the car, but Jimmy didn't know what to do about it.

The pronouns "He" and "it" may cause confusion. The pronoun "He" comes before what it refers to. The pronoun "it" may refer to either seeing the car, or to the car. Don't use a pronoun before the reader knows what the pronoun refers to, and don't use a pronoun that has more than one interpretation.

This is another example of ambiguous pronouns:

>Sara, Jennie and Ben were better runners than David and Tim. They weren't running now, though.

The word "They" in the second sentence is ambiguous. "They" may refer to both Sara, Jennie and Ben, or David and Tim. Avoid ambiguity when using pronouns.

**Use imperatives**:

Use imperative sentences where you may have been repeating phrases like "you can" or "you should". However, imperatives shouldn't dominate the body of your text, so make sure that not every sentence you write is an imperative.

<br>

### Using white space:

Use white space to make your documents easier to read. For the purposes of this document, white space is the space in between paragraphs and sentences. White space provides a break from reading and separation between units of text.

**Using paragraphs**:

If you want to use white space, you should sort your sentences into paragraphs. Paragraphs should be between 3-5 sentences long. Use one line of white space after every paragraph.

Note: Paragraphs should start off with a sentence that sets the topic for the paragraph. The rest of the paragraph should explain why the topic is important, and what the reader should do about it. If your topic is properly presented and explained, your readers will learn without confusion. Once you've established the topic in your first sentence, you should keep following the same topic throughout the paragraph.

**Using lists**:
Formatted lists are another way to create white space between sentences. Lines in a formatted list can be shorter than the lines of a paragraph, leaving more white space around the list. Replace inline lists with formatted lists to add more white space.

Note: Formatted lists grab attention. The information in a formatted list stands out and is easier to read when compared to the body of the list. Therefore, formatted lists should be used to present important information. For example, use formatted lists to describe a sequence of tasks you want a reader to perform.

The following sentence contains an inline list:
> David, Johannes, Rafael and Sara write code at S-Corp.

You can turn the sentence above into a formatted list:
> S-Corp programmers:
>
> * David
> * Johannes
> * Rafael
> * Sara

<br>

### Using transitions

Transitions tie clauses, sentences or paragraphs together while showing a relation: 

**Addition**:

* additionally
* and
* furthermore
* likewise
* similarily

**Contradiction**:

* but
* despite
* however
* instead
* or

**Elaboration**:

* because
* consequently
* for example
* so
* therefore

**Time**:

* during
* then
* meanwhile
* once
* while

Depending on your purposes, there are other ways to categorize transitions, but suffice it to say that transitions create a relationship between pieces of your text. Consider the following sentences:
> I drove the car. My wife was at work.

There's no relationship between these two sentences, just two people doing two different things. Add a transition the the second sentence to tie the sentences together:
> I drove the car. Meanwhile, my wife was at work.

Now, the two sentences are related in time. In fact, these two sentences can become one:
> I drove the car while my wife was at work.

Note: Although shorter sentences are less complex, two short clauses connected like in the sentence above may flow better.

The following sentence tells a reader why *I* drove the car:
> I drove the car because my wife was at work.

Note: Without context, the sentence above may not be entirely clear, but it establishes a clear relationship between the two statements.

Certain style guides for technical writing suggest that three transitions are especially important for connecting sentences and paragraphs in technical writing:

* for example
* however
* therefore

Therefore, it may be a good idea to rely on these specific transitions to connect sentences and paragraphs when writing a first draft.

## Final words

As stated at the start of this document, this guide isn't objective truth. For instance, you may find that other trategies work better for you, or that a specific style guide contradicts this guide. However, I hope you've gained some insight into how I see technical writing, and that I've provided you with some inspiration for your next project.
